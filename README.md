# buttons (JS, HTML)
A chrome extension to stylize buttons on webpages. Takes styles defined in the popup or options page and applies them to elements using the button tag that do not have CSS overrides. Using vanilla JS and HTML to build the options page. Screenshots of the options page and toolbar popup are visible at popup_example.png and options_example.png to see what it looks like locally, but the extension is unpublished.
